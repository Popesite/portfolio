# PopeSites Landing Page

In order for us to have a pressence on Google and to start getting some business, we need to have a home base. This home base must be a website where we can host our portfolio so potential clients can see our work before they contact us. So, the first order of business is to create a portfolio with all of our past works. This will make it easy for clients to see what we are capable of, and what we can do for them.

## GitHub Pages

If possible, I propose that we setup the portfolio on GitHub pages so that we don't have to pay for any hosting. Firstly, we must come up with an operating name that we can all agree on, so I will begin brainstorming names. Will update this with a list of potential names shortly...
